- FarmPredict by Fan et al. (2021)

## RMBI 4310 Advanced Data Mining for Risk Management and Business Intelligence
Includes the completed Report and codes for Project 1 - Sentiment Analysis (TFIDF-BiLSTM-Numerical-MLP Model). (Note: As I am enrolling the course this term (2021 Spring), codes on other projects will be updated later.)

## COMP 4331 Data Mining
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning using Bayes, ID3, C4.5, K-means Clustering, DBScan, etc.
Written in Python (and the course instructor requires us to avoid using libraries in this course).

## COMP 4462 Data Visualization
Data Visualization Group Project (mainly in JavaScript and Python). It includes 4 dynamic designs (html, CSS, JavaScript) and 3 static designs (Python: using matplotlib and numpy).
